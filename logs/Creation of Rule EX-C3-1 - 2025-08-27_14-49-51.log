Hello! Let's create the rule for the clinical scenario EX-C3-1 😊
I will need some information about the rule and the API
⚙️ First: are you updating an existing rule? If so, insert the guid, if not, leave empty: 
👤 What is the patient profile associated to this configuration? (e.g 'Regular', 'Heart failure', 'Pneumonia'..) Pneumonia
    🩺 Lower MEWS score threshold for this profile (e.g. 5): 5
    🩺 Lower HR attribute score threshold for this profile (e.g. 2): 2
    🩺 Lower RR attribute score threshold for this profile (e.g. 2): 2
    🩺 Lower Temp attribute score threshold for this profile (e.g. 2): 2
    🩺 Lower SpO2 attribute score threshold for this profile (e.g. 2): 2
    🩺 Lower BP attribute score threshold for this profile (e.g. 2): 2
✒️ What name do you want to give to the rule? (Keep in mind that the name will start with EX-C3-1 - Pneumonia ):EX-C3-1 - Pneumonia - MEWS score advisory
🛌 Beds on which the rule has to run (if more than one, divide the numbers with a comma): 1
❓ Do you want the rule to stop if one of the expressions raise an error? (Type Y or N): Y
🌍 Enter the domain of the API (Press Enter for https://digistat.sasicu.ascom-demo.local): https://www.google.com
To begin we need the IDs of the parameters to store the following calculated parameters:
 MEWS score 
 MEWS attribute of HR 
 MEWS attribute of RR 
 MEWS attribute of Temp 
 MEWS attribute of SpO2 
 MEWS attribute of BP
Have you already created them? (y/n)⚙️ Parameter ID of MEWS score: 101
⚙️ Parameter ID of MEWS attribute of HR: 102
⚙️ Parameter ID of MEWS attribute of RR:
