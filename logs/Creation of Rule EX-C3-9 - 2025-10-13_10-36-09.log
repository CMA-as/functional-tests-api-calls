Hello! Let's create the rule for the clinical scenario EX-C3-9 😊
I will need some information about the rule and the API
⚙️ First: are you updating an existing rule? If so, insert the guid, if not, leave empty: 
👤 What is the patient profile associated to this configuration? (e.g 'Regular', 'Heart failure', 'Pneumonia'..) NICU patient
    🩺 Lower SpO2 Riemann integral threshold for this profile (e.g. 95): 95
    🩺 How many seconds should the integral be calculated over? (e.g. 60): 60
✒️ What name do you want to give to the rule? (Keep in mind that the name will start with EX-C3-9 - NICU patient ):EX-C3-9 - NICU patient - spo2 dips
🛌 Beds on which the rule has to run (if more than one, divide the numbers with a comma): 4
❓ Do you want the rule to stop if one of the expressions raise an error? (Type Y or N): y
🌍 Enter the domain of the API (Press Enter for https://digistat.sasicu.ascom-demo.local): https://digistat.sasicu.ascom-demo.local
To begin we need the IDs of the parameter to store the following calculated parameter:
 SpO2 Riemann Integral of the last 60 seconds
Have you already created them? (y/n)⚙️ Parameter ID of SpO2 Riemann integral over 60 seconds: 80054

Thank you! I have everything that I need now 😊. 
I will keep you updated about the steps that I am doing

STEP 1 : Creation of expressions
    These are the expressions that I will use: 

    Calculation Riemann Integral SpO2: Integral(7501,60,95,true,2)
    Advisory: Advisory()
STEP 2 : Creation of the formulas
