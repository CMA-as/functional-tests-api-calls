Hello! Let's create the rule for the clinical scenario EX-C2-7-2 😊
I will need some information about the rule and the API
⚙️ First: are you updating an existing rule? If so, insert the guid, if not, leave empty: b1f2d240-852a-48e6-a094-fcfe9baf4e6b
b1f2d240-852a-48e6-a094-fcfe9baf4e6b
👤 What is the patient profile associated to this configuration? (e.g 'Regular', 'COPD', 'Post-operative'..) nicu
nicu
    🩺 What value of Sp02 should trigger the advisory? (e.g. 90): 90
    🩺 What is the priority of the Advisory of low Sp=2? (e.g. 3): 3
✒️ What name do you want to give to the rule? (Keep in mind that the name will start with EX-C2-7-2 - nicu ):EX-C2-7-2 - nicu - spo2 dips
EX-C2-7-2 - nicu - spo2 dips
🛌 Beds on which the rule has to run (if more than one, divide the numbers with a comma): ['4']
['4']
❓ Do you want the rule to stop if one of the expressions raise an error? (Type Y or N): True
True
🌍 Enter the domain of the API (Press Enter for https://digistat.sasicu.ascom-demo.local): https://digistat.sasicu.ascom-demo.local
https://digistat.sasicu.ascom-demo.local

Thank you! I have everything that I need now 😊. 
I will keep you updated about the steps that I am doing

STEP 1 : Creation of expressions
    These are the expressions that I will use: 

    Advisory: Advisory(( #7501 < 90),'EX-C2-7-2-lowspO2',3,'Low SpO2 detected')
STEP 2 : Creation of the formulas
    These are the formulas that we will use

    {'Expression': "Advisory(( #7501 < 90),'EX-C2-7-2-lowspO2',3,'Low SpO2 detected')", 'OutputParamId': 0, 'OutputUnitId': 8, 'ValidityQuantThreashold': 0, 'ValiditySpreadThreashold': 0, 'DecimalPosition': 2}

STEP 3 : Creation of the rule
    This is the rule that we will use
{
    "Description": "EX-C2-7-2 - nicu - spo2 dips",
    "Locations": [
        "4"
    ],
    "StopAtFirstException": true,
    "Formulas": [
        {
            "Expression": "Advisory(( #7501 < 90),'EX-C2-7-2-lowspO2',3,'Low SpO2 detected')",
            "OutputParamId": 0,
            "OutputUnitId": 8,
            "ValidityQuantThreashold": 0,
            "ValiditySpreadThreashold": 0,
            "DecimalPosition": 2
        }
    ]
}
STEP 4 : Let's upload that!
