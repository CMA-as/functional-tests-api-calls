Hello! Let's create the rule for the clinical scenario EX-C2-7-2 😊
I will need some information about the rule and the API
⚙️ First: are you updating an existing rule? If so, insert the guid, if not, leave empty: 52f28500-09fe-427f-9804-3f7c350a347a

    🩺 What value of Sp02 should trigger the advisory? (e.g. 90): 90
    🩺 What is the priority of the Advisory of low Sp=2? (e.g. 3): 3
✒️ What name do you want to give to the rule? (Keep in mind that the name will start with EX-C2-7-2 - COPD ):EX-C2-7-2 - COPD - desaturation advisory

Thank you! I have everything that I need now 😊. 
I will keep you updated about the steps that I am doing

STEP 1 : Creation of expressions
    These are the expressions that I will use: 

    Advisory: Advisory(( #7501 < 90),'EX-C2-7-2-lowspO2',3,'Low SpO2 detected')
STEP 2 : Creation of the formulas
