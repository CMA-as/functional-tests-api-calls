Hello! Let's create the rule for the clinical scenario EX-C3-1 😊
I will need some information about the rule and the API
⚙️ First: are you updating an existing rule? If so, insert the guid, if not, leave empty: 
👤 What is the patient profile associated to this configuration? (e.g 'Regular', 'Heart failure', 'Pneumonia'..) ICU
    🩺 Lower MEWS score threshold for this profile (e.g. 5): 5
    🩺 Lower HR attribute score threshold for this profile (e.g. 2): 2
    🩺 Lower RR attribute score threshold for this profile (e.g. 2): 2
    🩺 Lower Temp attribute score threshold for this profile (e.g. 2): 2
    🩺 Lower SpO2 attribute score threshold for this profile (e.g. 2): 2
    🩺 Lower BP attribute score threshold for this profile (e.g. 2): 2
✒️ What name do you want to give to the rule? (Keep in mind that the name will start with EX-C3-1 - ICU ):EX-C3-1 - ICU - 
🛌 Beds on which the rule has to run (if more than one, divide the numbers with a comma): 1
❓ Do you want the rule to stop if one of the expressions raise an error? (Type Y or N): y
🌍 Enter the domain of the API (Press Enter for https://digistat.sasicu.ascom-demo.local): https://www.google.com
To begin we need the IDs of the parameters to store the following calculated parameters:
 MEWS score 
 MEWS attribute of HR 
 MEWS attribute of RR 
 MEWS attribute of Temp 
 MEWS attribute of SpO2 
 MEWS attribute of BP
Have you already created them? (y/n)⚙️ Parameter ID of MEWS score: 100
⚙️ Parameter ID of MEWS attribute of HR: 101
⚙️ Parameter ID of MEWS attribute of RR: 102
⚙️ Parameter ID of MEWS attribute of Temp: 103
⚙️ Parameter ID of MEWS attribute of SpO2: 104
⚙️ Parameter ID of MEWS attribute of BP: 105

Thank you! I have everything that I need now 😊. 
I will keep you updated about the steps that I am doing

STEP 1 : Creation of expressions

    These are the expressions that I will use: 
    Calculation RR MEWS attribute: If(#4004 <= 8, 1, If(#4004 <= 11, 1, If(#4004 <= 20, 0, If(#4004 <= 24, 2, 3))))
    Calculation SPO2 MEWS attribute: If(#7501 <= 91, 3, If(#7501 <= 93, 2, If(#7501 <= 95, 1, 0)))
    Calculation TEMP MEWS attribute: If(#6034 <= 35.0, 3, If(#6034 <= 36.0, 1, If(#6034 <= 38.0, 0, If(#6034 <= 39.0, 1, 2))))
    Calculation BP MEWS attribute: If(#3027 <= 90, 3, If(#3027 <= 100, 2, If(#3027 <= 110, 1, 0)))
    Calculation HR MEWS attribute: If(#2001 <= 40, 3, If(#2001 <= 50, 1, If(#2001 <= 90, 0, If(#2001 <= 100, 1, If(#2001 <= 130, 2, 3)))))
