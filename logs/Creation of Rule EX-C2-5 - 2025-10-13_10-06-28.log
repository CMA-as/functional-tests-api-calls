Hello! Let's create the rule for the clinical scenario EX-C2-5 😊
I will need some information about the rule and the API
⚙️ First: are you updating an existing rule? If so, insert the guid, if not, leave empty: 
👤 What is the patient profile associated to this configuration? (e.g 'Regular', 'COPD', 'Post-operative'..) Post-operative
    🩺 Lower HR threshold for this profile (e.g. 40): 40
    🩺 Upper HR threshold for this profile (e.g. 120): 120
    🩺 Lower ABP threshold for this profile (e.g. 60): 60
    🩺 Upper ABP threshold for this profile (e.g. 140): 140
✒️ What name do you want to give to the rule? (Keep in mind that the name will start with EX-C2-5 - Post-operative ):EX-C2-5 - Post-operative - post operative bleeding
🛌 Beds on which the rule has to run (if more than one, divide the numbers with a comma): 4
❓ Do you want the rule to stop if one of the expressions raise an error? (Type Y or N): y
🌍 Enter the domain of the API (Press Enter for https://digistat.sasicu.ascom-demo.local): https://digistat.sasicu.ascom-demo.local

Thank you! I have everything that I need now 😊. 
I will keep you updated about the steps that I am doing

STEP 1 : Creation of expression
    This is the expression that I will use: 
    Advisory(((#2001 > 120) OR (#2001 < 40)) AND ((#3029 > 140) OR (#3029 < 60)),'EX-C2-5-postoperativebleeding',  2,'Potential post-operative bleeding')

STEP 2 : Creation of the formula
    This is the formula that we will use
{
    "Expression": "Advisory(((#2001 > 120) OR (#2001 < 40)) AND ((#3029 > 140) OR (#3029 < 60)),'EX-C2-5-postoperativebleeding',  2,'Potential post-operative bleeding')",
    "OutputParamId": 0,
    "OutputUnitId": 8,
    "ValidityQuantThreashold": 0,
    "ValiditySpreadThreashold": 0,
    "DecimalPosition": 2
}
STEP 3 : Creation of the rule
    This is the rule that we will use
{
    "Description": "EX-C2-5 - Post-operative - post operative bleeding",
    "Locations": [
        "4"
    ],
    "StopAtFirstException": true,
    "Formulas": [
        {
            "Expression": "Advisory(((#2001 > 120) OR (#2001 < 40)) AND ((#3029 > 140) OR (#3029 < 60)),'EX-C2-5-postoperativebleeding',  2,'Potential post-operative bleeding')",
            "OutputParamId": 0,
            "OutputUnitId": 8,
            "ValidityQuantThreashold": 0,
            "ValiditySpreadThreashold": 0,
            "DecimalPosition": 2
        }
    ]
}
STEP 4 : Let's upload that!
