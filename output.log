Hello! Let's create the rule for the clinical scenario EX-C2-5 😊
I will need some information about the rule and the API
⚙️ First: are you updating an existing rule? If so, insert the guid, if not, leave empty: 👤 What is the patient profile associated to this configuration? (e.g 'Regular', 'COPD', 'Post-operative'..)     🩺 Lower HR threshold for this profile (e.g. 40):     🩺 Upper HR threshold for this profile (e.g. 120):     🩺 Lower ABP threshold for this profile (e.g. 60):     🩺 Upper ABP threshold for this profile (e.g. 140): ✒️ What name do you want to give to the rule? (Keep in mind that the name will start with EX-C2-5 - Post-operative ):🛌 Beds on which the rule has to run (if more than one, divide the numbers with a comma): ❓ Do you want the rule to stop if one of the expressions raise an error? (Type Y or N): 🌍 Enter the domain of the API (Press Enter for https://digistat.sasicu.ascom-demo.local): 
Thank you! I have everything that I need now 😊. 
I will keep you updated about the steps that I am doing

STEP 1 : Creation of expression

    This is the expression that I will use: 
    Advisory((#2001 > 120 OR #2001<40 ) AND (#3029 > 140 OR #3029 < 60),'message of advisory',  2,'message of advisory')

STEP 2 : Creation of the formula

    This rule has only one formula that generates an advisory. 
Therefore we don't need to store anything in a new parameter
    This is the formula that we will use
    {'Expression': "Advisory((#2001 > 120 OR #2001<40 ) AND (#3029 > 140 OR #3029 < 60),'message of advisory',  2,'message of advisory')", 'OutputParamId': 0, 'OutputUnitId': 8, 'ValidityQuantThreashold': 0, 'ValiditySpreadThreashold': 0, 'DecimalPosition': 2}

STEP 3 : Creation of the rule

    This is the rule that we will use
    {'Description': 'EX-C2-5 - Post-operative - rule', 'Locations': [4], 'StopAtFirstException': True, 'Formulas': [{'Expression': "Advisory((#2001 > 120 OR #2001<40 ) AND (#3029 > 140 OR #3029 < 60),'message of advisory',  2,'message of advisory')", 'OutputParamId': 0, 'OutputUnitId': 8, 'ValidityQuantThreashold': 0, 'ValiditySpreadThreashold': 0, 'DecimalPosition': 2}]}

STEP 4 : Let's upload that!
